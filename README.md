# SORTEDLISTADT
Implement the SortedList class.
The SortedList class extends
the List class. Your assignment is to
implement (recursively) all of the 
abstract methods of the List class.

They are:
  insert (recursive)
  iterator
  remove (recursive)
  retrieve (recursive)
  search (recursive)
  
You must also implement an Iterator inner class for the
SortedList class.
